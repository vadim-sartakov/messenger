# Messenger Application

Simple text messenger application without registration built with React and Node.js

## How it works

Users can login with their name only, no password or registration required. After that user can create a chat, invite other people with an invite link and start a conversation.

Note that after logout it is not possible to login back to previous session, so all conversations will be lost.
